{"title":"Onomatopoeia odyssey","body":{"intro":{"hed":"Onomatopoeia odyssey","subhed":"How do animals sound in different languages?","byline":"vivian li","bylineLink":"https://pudding.cool/author/vivian-li/","component":"IPA","content":[{"type":"text","value":"Since its English origin hundreds of years ago, the lyrics of \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\" have been translated into at least 25 languages. In comparing translations of this classic children’s song, a curious finding reveals itself. English cows go \"moo,\" while French cows go \"meuh,\" and Japanese cows go \"mō.\" These differences beg the question: <b>how can cultures hear the same physical sounds yet translate them into language so differently?</b> Analyzing the phonetics of animal sounds in different languages can demystify how we shape sound into meaning."},{"type":"text","value":"Languages differ in their written characters, so we need look beyond translations to effectively compare how they sound. We'll need to use a common tool of linguists: the <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/the-international-phonetic-alphabet\">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>, or \"IPA.\" <b>IPA</b> is an internationally recognized alphabet that is used to show how words are pronounced in any language. Each letter in the alphabet represents a singular sound, also known as a <b>phone</b>. Here's an example with \"meow,\" a cat's sound in English:"},{"type":"component","value":"ipaCatExample"},{"type":"text","value":"\"Meow\" in English becomes a string of phones: <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[m]</span>, <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[i]</span>, <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[a]</span>, and <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[w]</span>. In Portuguese, cats go \"miau,\" which is spelled different, but is actually composed of the exact same phones — <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[miaw]</span>. On the other hand, in Polish, cats go \"miau,\" which may <i>look</i> the same as in Portuguese, but is actually transcribed as <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[mjav]</span>. In this way, IPA can show the similarities in pronunciation across words that may look totally different, or differences across words that look similar."},{"type":"text","value":"Let's take a look at a few animal sounds across 21 common languages. In the following examples, phones are color-coded to simplify our understanding of the IPA transcriptions by showing their phonetic similarity. For instance, <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[<span class=\"pink\">m</span>]</span> and <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[<span class=\"pink\">n</span>]</span> are both <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/nasal-speech-sound\">nasal consonants</a> and serve a very similar purpose as the start of the cat sound (e.g. “meow”), so they're grouped by color as a visual aid. Similarly, <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[<span class=\"yellow\">i</span>]</span> and <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[<span class=\"yellow\">j</span>]</span> both make a sound similar to \"eee\" sound, so they're both shown as yellow. Some symbols also indicate subtle variations in pronunciation without altering the overall sound. For example, \"ː\" is appended to a phone like <span class=\"inline-ipa\">[aː]</span> to draw out the sound's length."}]},"scrolly":{"steps":[{"id":"cat","text":"Here's how a cat sounds in 21 languages.
